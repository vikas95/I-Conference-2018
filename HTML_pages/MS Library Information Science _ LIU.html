<strong>Are there any awards or scholarships offered for alumni of&nbsp;LIU Post?</strong>
<p>Incoming graduate students applying for their first master&rsquo;s degree who graduated with their bachelor&rsquo;s degree from any LIU campus may be considered for a limited number of one-time, one semester $1,000 Graduate Alumni Awards.</p>
<strong>I applied through&nbsp;LIU Post; can I also take classes at the Palmer Manhattan site?</strong>
<p>Yes, once admitted to Palmer, students may take classes at any of our sites and are encouraged to do so. Classes are offered at any of our sites: LIU Post, Palmer Manhattan at NYU and Brentwood.</p>
<strong>Can I complete the entire program at the Brentwood site?</strong>
<p>You will be required to take 3 residency credits at LIU Post or Palmer Manhattan. However, we sometimes offer hybrid classes which means that you may only have to come to Post or Palmer Manhattan for 3 or 4 in-person sessions. The rest will be online. You can complete the entire program in Manhattan at Palmer&rsquo;s site at NYU.</p>
<strong>It is too late to apply for scholarships, is there some other kind of financial assistance available besides applying for financial aid?</strong>
<p>Paid Academic Assistantships are &nbsp;sometimes &nbsp;available through the Palmer School Library Director&rsquo;s office. In addition to earning money, Academic Assistantships afford our students valuable hands-on experience in an academic setting.<br />
We also encourage students to take advantage of opportunities that may come through our student listserv, kiosk.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>I understand we are required to complete an internship-can I use my work experience or do it at my place of employment?</strong>
<p>The internship is intended to provide students with a professional experience in the field that broadens their current experience and their network of professional contacts. For these reasons, it is best to intern in a setting different from your place of employment. You may complete the internship at your place of employment, provided it is a totally different work assignment, library related with professional (library) supervision, who is not your current supervisor. The internship can be waived if a student has depending on the student&rsquo;s extensive professional experience. In that case, a master&rsquo;s project will be required in its place.</p>
<strong>Will I have an opportunity to speak with a professional in the field?</strong>
<p>All students have access to an academic advisor and are encouraged to speak with our faculty who have specific areas of expertise and interest. Faculty office hours are scheduled for meetings to meet with students and can help you with any questions or concerns about your career and academic goals.</p>
<strong>Is there any career counseling available?</strong>
<p>The Employer Relations department connects employers to students and students to job opportunities. You can &nbsp;search for career opportunities online through our&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=15E2E9821787467181D79CC82E9B5617&amp;_z=z">LIU Career Connect system</a>.<br />
<br />
Career Advisement is done through the LIU Promise Office. &nbsp;Hours of operation are Monday &ndash; Friday from 9am &ndash; 7pm and Saturday&rsquo;s 9am-2pm. The services provided are, Resume Review, Cover Letter / Personal Statement Review, Job Search, Networking/Social Media Etiquette, Career Assessment Tools and Classroom Presentations for Faculty Members. &nbsp; We provide a series of workshop throughout the semester and Career Bar officer hours.<br />
<br />
In addition, the Palmer School posts jobs, with descriptions, on the students&rsquo; list serv KIOSK. Students are encouraged to check their e-mail from KIOSK at least once a day. In addition to job postings, information about classes, workshops, and scholarships are posted immediately. It&rsquo;s also an excellent source of information in terms of offering job descriptions and skills required for a number of librarian and information specialist careers.</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<strong>What is the current job situation?</strong>
<p>Palmer School graduates enjoy among the highest job placement rates, and top salaries, of all graduate Library and Information Science schools. We encourage students to be proactive in their search and their career by joining professional organizations, volunteering, networking and attending professional association meetings. The internship experience often leads to career opportunities.
