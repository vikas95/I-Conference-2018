<h2><div class="long_header">Master&#8217;s Programs</div></h2>
<div>
The purpose of the MLIS program is to prepare librarians and information professionals who are able to manage change in an urbanized, technologically oriented, and knowledge-based society. The MLIS program provides a systematic course of study which enables individuals with a strong service orientation to apply principles of library and information science, use current methods and tools, and recognize the value of research.<br /><br />

Students may elect to specialize according to the type of library or information service which best meets their needs: i.e., school, public, academic, or special; or to follow a more generalized approach. Concentrations in archival studies, information organization, information technology, and public libraries are available.<br />
<br />

Graduates of the Master of Library and Information Science degree program are expected to demonstrate the following competencies:

<ol>
<li>To apply scientific principles in developing and managing information resources designed to meet user needs and interests. </li>
<li>To analyze, describe, and organize resources for effective and efficient retrieval and dissemination of information. </li>
<li>To utilize knowledge of information sources, services, and systems to meet the informational needs of users. </li>
<li>To apply management principles in planning, developing, marketing, and evaluating library and information services. </li>
<li>To work in specialized areas of library and information service, utilizing knowledge obtained from concentrations within the School and in other disciplines. </li>
<li>To build upon current knowledge of information and communication theories and technologies in planning, design, development, and delivery of information services. </li>
</ol>

The master&#8217;s degree program is designed to support each of these objectives with appropriate coursework and educational experiences.<br /><br />

The School of Information Studies in collaboration with the School of Education offers post-bachelor&#8217;s programs leading to State of Wisconsin licensing as Initial Instructional Library Media Specialist, Instructional Library Media Specialist, and Instructional Library Media Supervisor.<br /><br />

Students admitted to the Master of Library and Information Science degree program can incorporate in their degree program the courses for these licenses to the extent that these courses satisfy the degree requirements, either as required core courses or as electives. Licenses will be granted only to those persons who are eligible to hold a Wisconsin license to teach in the elementary or secondary schools or who have completed an approved elementary or secondary classroom teacher preparation program. For additional information about these licenses and their relationship to the master&#8217;s degree, consult the School Library Media Coordinator.<br /><br />

The advanced courses offered by the School of Information Studies may be elected on a non-degree basis by post-master&#8217;s students who wish to continue their professional education or special competence in some phase of urban library and information services. The School&#8217;s graduate courses are also open to graduate students in other fields of study, provided that they have completed the appropriate basic courses (or their equivalent).

Each student is assigned a faculty advisor in the School of Information Studies at the time of admission to the master&#8217;s program. The name of the faculty advisor is included in the student&#8217;s letter of admission and may also be obtained from an academic advisor in the School of Information Studies.<br /><br />

<b>Credits and Courses</b><br />
The minimum degree requirement is 36 graduate credits, 30 of which must be in library and information science and up to 6 of which may be in related areas. Students who have already completed a master&#8217;s or doctoral degree in a field other than library science may have the library and information science master&#8217;s program reduced to 30 credits. Under special circumstances, up to 6 of these credits may be from another field in a closely allied area with advisor consent. Students who have completed library science courses at the undergraduate level may, upon request, have their coursework reviewed to determine whether the content was the equivalent of that in required courses in the School of Information Studies Program. However, the establishment of such equivalencies will not reduce the total number of credits required for the master&#8217;s degree in library and information science, but merely enable the student to avoid unnecessary repetition.<br /><br />

The number of credits needed for each of the coordinated degree programs is 12 credits less than the sum of credits of the two programs if taken separately. All degree requirements of each component program, however, must be satisfied. This includes makeup courses for deficiencies, required courses, and graduation proficiency requirements. The MLIS component of each coordinated program includes 30 credits of SOIS courses including the 12 credits of required courses.<br /><br />

The following are basic required courses:<br /><br />

INFOST 501 Foundations of Library and Information Science, 3 cr.<br />
INFOST 511 Organization of Information, 3 cr.<br />
INFOST 571 Information Access and Retrieval, 3 cr.<br />
INFOST 591 Introduction to Research Methods in Library and Information Science, 3 cr.<br />
<em><strong>Effective Fall 2016:</strong></em> INFOST 591 is being replaced with INFOST 799<br />
<br />

These courses (or their equivalent) must be completed by full-time students by the end of their second semester; for part-time students, two of the courses must be completed by the end of the second semester, and all four by the end of the fifth semester for coursework in the School of Information Studies.<br /><br />

<b>Minimum Grade Requirement in the Basic Required Courses</b><br />
The minimum grade requirement for 501, 511, 571, and 591 is a B. Students who earn a grade of B- or lower have not met the minimum requirement and will be allowed to repeat the core course once. Students are responsible for tuition in the repeated course. Those who do not meet the minimum grade requirements upon repeating the course will be recommended for academic dismissal. Students may not register for a course for which any of the core courses is a prerequisite until the minimum grade requirement is met.<br /><br />

<b>Proficiency Requirement in Library and Information Science</b><br />
This course of study requires students to demonstrate proficiency in the field of library and information science. There are two options for completing the proficiency requirement: passing a comprehensive examination or completing and successfully defending a thesis.<br /><br />

<b>Capstone Project</b><br />
The MLIS Capstone Project involves identifying an information problem in a real-world setting and developing the means to address it.  There are 5 phases with deadlines throughout the term.  Each phase of the project requires a submission to D2L which will be evaluated by an instructor who has been assigned to oversee projects in specific sections.  The final outcome of the Capstone Project may be in the form of a poster, a webpage, a journal article, an app, or some other product (approved by instructor).<br /><br />

<b>Thesis Option</b><br />
Students choosing the thesis option must take at least three credits of thesis coursework in addition to the 36 credits required for the comprehensive examination option, making the minimum credits required for the thesis option 39 credits. However, only 3 credits of thesis coursework may count towards the total degree credit requirement of 39. Those who already have a graduate degree must complete a minimum of 33 credits for this option.<br /><br />

Students who choose the thesis option in the coordinated master&#8217;s degree programs also need to take an additional 3 credits of thesis coursework. Thus, while total degree credits vary among the coordinated master&#8217;s programs, the Master of Library and Information Science component of each requires 33 credits of SOIS coursework, three of which would be taken as thesis credit. Students pursuing thesis options in both programs will be required to fulfill each program&#8217;s thesis requirement and complete two separate theses.<br /><br />

Students in the thesis option also must take a minimum of three credits of research methods. More may be required by individual circumstances, but only the first three credits may count toward degree credit requirements. Either 540-890, Research Methods in Library and Information Science, or a comparable course chosen in consultation with the major professor, can contribute towards satisfaction of this requirement. Students must complete the five core courses in addition to the research methods requirement before defense of the thesis proposal can occur.<br /><br />

Students must register for a variable credit thesis research course L&amp;I Sci 540-898: Master&#8217;s Thesis (1-3 credits), during every semester of thesis work.<br /><br />

Students may select the thesis option at any point in their course of study, but are encouraged to make this decision and form their thesis committee as early as possible to avoid the necessity of taking additional coursework. The faculty advisor assigned to each student upon admission may serve as the student&#8217;s thesis advisor, but is not required to do so. It is the student&#8217;s responsibility to enter into a mutually agreed upon advising relationship with a thesis advisor in SOIS, who then serves as chair of the thesis committee.<br /><br />

Likewise, a student may withdraw from the thesis option and pursue the comprehensive examination option; however, the student would need to meet the registration and other requirements for the comprehensive examination set forth in SOIS policies and procedures as published in the SOIS Bulletin.<br /><br />

Students must pass an oral examination in defense of the thesis. The thesis defense may be repeated once.<br /><br />

<b>Time Limit</b><br />
Students in the 36-credit program must complete all degree requirements within seven years of initial enrollment. Students in the 30-credit program must complete all degree requirements within five years of initial enrollment.

<b>Major Professor as Advisor</b><br />
Unless a student specifically requests a particular faculty member, all doctoral students initially are assigned an &#8220;interim&#8221; advisor. After the completion of 12 credits, a student is required to designate a faculty member from an approved list of major professors with specialized interests compatible with those of the student to act as the major professor. The major professor is expected to assist the student in planning the remainder of the program of studies, chair the student&#8217;s preliminary examination committee, supervise the completion of the Ph.D. dissertation, and conduct the dissertation defense meeting. All students should consult the program handbook for additional details on school policies and procedures.<br /><br />
<b>Residence</b><br />
The student must meet minimum Graduate School residence requirements of one continuous academic year of full-time graduate studies at UWM; physical residency in Milwaukee is not necessary. This can be satisfied by completing at least 8 graduate credits in each of two consecutive semesters, or 6 or more graduate credits in each of three consecutive semesters, exclusive of summer sessions. Residence credit cannot be earned at the master&#8217;s level.<br /><br />

<b>Distance Students</b><br />
Distance students (not located near Milwaukee, Wisconsin) are encouraged to apply. Such students will be required to attend a week-long orientation on campus at the beginning of the program, and be physically present for all major program milestones, including preliminary exam defense, dissertation proposal defense, and formal defense of the dissertation. SOIS doctoral seminars will be streamed live online for distance students to participate synchronously with local students and faculty, and students will be responsible for meeting all other program requirements via online courses or other approved means. Students begin the Information Studies doctoral program in the fall. Application materials for distance option students is June 30. An applicant whose file is incomplete will be asked to contact the Graduate School. Application requirements are the same for traditional and distance students. Distance students must also meet the UWM Graduate School residency requirements; physical residency in Milwaukee is not necessary.<br /><br />

<div class="accordion">
<h2><div class="long_header">Doctoral Program Coursework</div></h2>
<div>

Standard Graduate School <a href="http://uwm.edu/graduateschool/academic-policies-procedures/" class="accordion_link">minimum and maximum credit loads</a> apply. Full-time students are discouraged from taking more than 9 credits per semester.<br /><br />

Students, along with their major professor, should develop a plan for coursework that will prepare the student to carry out research in their areas of interest. Although an identified dissertation topic is not required upon entry to the program, students should begin to formulate ideas for potential topics as soon as possible thereafter.<br /><br />

<div class="accordion">
<h2>
  <div class="long_header">Foundation Courses in Information Studies (12 credits)</div></h2>
<div>
All students must complete the following required courses: 901 Current Issues in Information Studies (3 credits), which surveys the key contemporary research issues in Information Studies; INFOST 910 Doctoral Seminar in the Organization of Information (3 credits), an in-depth and critical study of the historical, philosophical, theoretical, and methodological foundation of the organization of information; INFOST 960 Doctoral Seminar in Information Policy (3 credits), an examination of the conceptual, institutional and practical foundations of information policy, law, and ethics; and INFOST 970 Doctoral Seminar in Information Retrieval (3 credits), exploring advanced research concepts, methods, and applications for information retrieval (IR) and its evaluation, and current topics of research interest to the IR community.
</div>

<h2><div class="long_header">Research Methods and Design (9 credits)</div></h2>
<div>All students are required to complete a minimum of 9 credits in research methods at the 700-level or higher. A minimum of 3 credits each must be taken in quantitative and qualitative methods. It is expected that all students will fulfill these requirements by completing INFOST 903 (Qualitative Research Methods in Information Studies) and INFOST 904 (Quantitative Research Methods in Information Studies). In exceptional cases, and with the approval of the major professor, a student may satisfy these research methods requirements through courses offered in other campus units. A minimum of 3 additional credits in approved research methods coursework is required. The particular focus of these 3 credits will be guided by the student&#8217;s planned research areas and may include coursework in research design, qualitative, quantitative, or other research methods. Additional coursework may be required at the discretion of the major professor.</div>

<h2>
  <div class="long_header">Specialized area (9 credits)</div></h2>
<div>
Students must complete a minimum of 9 credits of coursework related to the specialized area(s) of their dissertation topics. Specific courses must be approved by the major professor. These coursework requirements may be met through approved existing graduate courses within SOIS, advanced special topics classes offered within SOIS at the 700-level or higher, independent research (INFOST 999), or courses offered outside of SOIS if approved by the major professor and the director of the Ph.D. program.
</div>

<h2><div class="long_header">Elective courses (3 credits)</div></h2>
<div>
Students may take 3 additional credits of electives upon the approval of the major professor. These credits may be selected from either within or outside of SOIS courses.
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><br />

<b>Preliminary Examinations / Preparatory Essays</b><br />
Students will be required to complete the doctoral preparatory essays towards the end of their coursework. The purpose of the essays will be to demonstrate the student&#8217;s mastery of coursework and relevant subject matter and the student&#8217;s qualifications to proceed with dissertation research. The essays will consist of three areas: research methods, the major area, and the minor area. The essays will represent non-credit research papers based on topics assigned by the student&#8217;s doctoral committee, which will consist of at least three members, including one representing the student&#8217;s minor. The timeline for completion of the essays will be at the committee&#8217;s discretion. Based on the committee&#8217;s assessment of the essays, students will be recommended for advancement toward the Ph.D. or academic dismissal from the program. If the essay results are found to be unsatisfactory, the student will have one opportunity to repeat the essay in a future semester after conferral with the major professor on how to prepare for the next attempt.<br /><br />

The preparatory essays must be successfully completed within four years of initial enrollment.<br /><br />

<b>Dissertation Proposal</b><br />
A doctoral committee of five faculty members will be in place by the time the student undertakes her/his dissertation proposal. The committee will consist of three members from the School of Information Studies, a faculty member in an allied area from outside the School, and a fifth member who may come from SOIS or another discipline. All doctoral committees shall be chaired by a major professor from the SOIS graduate faculty. Approval of the dissertation proposal, which ordinarily should occur within two semesters after successfully passing the preparatory essays, allows a student to proceed towards completion of the dissertation.<br /><br />

<b>Dissertation</b><br />
The candidate must write a dissertation which demonstrates her/his ability to formulate a research topic and pursue independent and original investigation that contributes to the knowledge base of the field.<br /><br />

<b>Dissertation Defense</b><br />
After submission of a reading copy of the dissertation to the student&#8217;s doctoral committee, the candidate and the major professor will schedule a committee meeting for the purpose of undertaking an oral defense of the dissertation work by the candidate. At the conclusion of the candidate&#8217;s oral remarks, the dissertation committee will vote on passing the candidate&#8217;s dissertation work. A majority of the committee must vote to approve the dissertation and recommend granting of the Doctor of Philosophy degree.<br /><br />

Approval of the dissertation by the student&#8217;s doctoral committee satisfies a final requirement for the Ph.D. degree in Information Studies from the UWM-SOIS.
<br /><br />

<b>Time Limit</b><br />
All components of the Ph.D. program must be completed within seven years of matriculation.<br /><br />
