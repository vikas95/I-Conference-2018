          <p>Composition and Communication II is the advanced course in a two-course sequence designed to engage students in composing and communicating ideas using speech, writing, and visuals. In this course, students will work in small groups to explore issues of public concern using rhetorical analysis, engage in deliberation, compose conscientious and well-developed arguments, and propose viable solutions to different audiences. Students will sharpen their ability to conduct research; compose and communicate in spoken, written, and visual forms; and work effectively in teams through sustained interrogation of an issue. A significant component of the class will involve learning to use visual and digital resources both to enhance written and oral presentations and to communicate with public audiences. Prereq: CIS 110.</p>

          <p>Composition and Communication 112 is an accelerated version of the standard two-semester composition and communication sequence. It focuses on integrated oral, written, and visual communication skill development and emphasizes critical inquiry and research. Students will sharpen their ability to conduct research; compose and communicate in written, oral, and visual modalities; and use interpersonal skills to work effectively in groups (dyads and small groups). In order to achieve these goals, students will explore issues of public concern in a profession that aligns with their career goals using exploratory, informative, and persuasive communication skills as both consumers and producers of information. Course members will develop complex arguments based on significant primary and secondary research, ultimately aimed at proposing a solution to their chosen issue. To do this, they will conduct individual, partner, and team-based work and produce a series of communication products that combine modalities (face to-face, written, oral, visual, digital) in different ways. A significant component of the class will consist of learning to use visual and digital resources, first to enhance written and oral presentations and later to communicate mass mediated messages to various public audiences.</p>

          <p>In today’s 24-7 culture, every choice we make comes with more data about which product/service/area is the “best” on a number of factors. The challenge, then, is sorting through the data to make an informed decision. In this course, you will be presented with several “real life” scenarios and then asked to use data to construct an appropriate written or oral response. Whether as information consumers or as information professionals, sorting through the data and making a decision that can be articulated to people unfamiliar with the issue is a key indicator of information literacy. Given that this course fulfills your Graduation Composition and Communication Requirement for Information Studies, you will be asked to write and revise several short pieces and complete one digital presentation.<em> (Meets Graduation Composition and Communication Requirement)</em></p>

          <p>With so many technologies in use today, information can often fail to effectively reach those who need it. In this course, students will focus on the importance of taking a human-centered approach to best identify and meet individuals’ and groups’ information needs. Human Relations and Technology focuses on engaging critical thinking skills to effectively tailor and disseminate information to people both within and outside of the IT industry. Through analysis and design, students will be asked to address multiple real-world situations with a specific focus on connecting to humans through (and often in spite of) technology.</p>

          <p>Universal design is a holistic concept that can be applied to everything from computer software to electronics to dishes. It is the idea that accessibility and usability standards should be blended together to create information that anyone can access. More specifically, web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to information on websites. When websites are correctly designed,developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality. The focus of the course is on how web accessibility can be implemented successfully in working environments by creating digital resources online that all consumers can use. In this course, you will learn how information must be presented that is flexible and adaptive to different users’ needs or preferences, accessible through a variety of different technologies and why it is easier and more cost effective to design websites and social media content correctly the first time than re-designing it later. Students will compare and contrast accessible and inaccessible websites and social media and also perform a web accessibility audit for an actual business.</p>

          <p>This course is designed to engage students with the deployment of multimedia within contemporary interactive technologies, including their historical and cultural contexts, underlying platforms, visual cultures, sociocultural dynamics, and technical components. The objective of this course is to help students cultivate conceptual tools that are of practical relevance that can be used while creating and engaging with multimedia tools, platforms, and artifacts both in their professional and personal lives. To this extent, the readings are carefully chosen to introduce foundational concepts of new media (Unit 1), associate and apply these concepts in their daily lived lives (Unit 2), and critically think about some of the broader implications of new media (Unit 3). The assignments are designed to cultivate critical analytical thinking by helping students apply the insights to day-to-day examples. Students are also required to complete two multimedia tool workshops as a part of their curriculum in order to gain practical skills.</p>

          <p>This course will provide a foundation in the area of data science based on data curation and statistical analysis. The primary goal of this course is for students to learn data analysis concepts and techniques that facilitate making decisions from a rich data set. St udents will investigate data concepts, metadata creation and interpretation, general linear method, cluster analysis, and basics of informa tion visualization. At the beginning, this course will introduce fundamentals about data and data standards and methods for organizi ng, curating, and preserving data for reuse. Then, we will focus on the inferential statistics: drawing conclusions and making decisions from  data. This course will help students understand how to use data analysis tools, and especially, provide an opportunity to utilize an open  source data analysis tool, R, for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Finally, in this course we will discuss diverse issues around data including technologies, behaviors, organizations, policies, and society. <em>Previously LIS 690 course.

          <p>This course examines three major categories of topics in relation to data analysis and visualization. First, this course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained from various sources, such as raw text files, web APIs, and data repositories. It will also cover the techniques of data cleaning and how to organize data for analysis. Second, the course will cover the essential techniques for analyzing quantitative data. It will teach prediction and clustering methods that are useful to solve various real data analysis tasks. In addition, students will learn major theories and recent methods in text analysis. Third, this course teaches how to create visualizations that effectively communicate the meanings behind data and information. The course will cover key practical skills in information visualization, such as plotting, mapping, and network visualization. This course will not be mathematically intensive. Instead, the course will use existing computational tools and programming libraries to solve various problems. You will use the R language and environment intensively for data analysis and visualization. <em>Previously an LIS 690 course, not offered yet. Fulfills IT requirment.</em></p>
